# Movie List
Implemented the following:
- creating movies
- updating movies
- deleting movies
- listing & filtering movies
- using a DB & React

## Set up
Requirements:
    - docker
    - docker-compose

1. docker-compose pull
2. docker-compose run npm i
3. docker-compose up

### Issues
Wait a moment for the Mysql database to be brought up and the init scripts to run
Also typescript for the API may take a moment to build
